Revision history for Perl extension SAS::Parser.

0.85  Thu Jun 6 10:06:47 1999
   - original version

0.86  10 Jun 1999 10:16:56
   - added eof(), includes() methods; parse_include() now returns the 
     resolved name of the included file.
   - added an output() method as the way to change output processing.
   - added doincludes option to control whether %include files are
     processed.

0.87  14 Jun 1999 13:47:11
   - Added Header.pm and sashead script
   - defined various useful parse_type() methods as NOOPs, so they may
     be overridden in sub classes.

0.88  16 Jun 1999 12:10:12
   - Revised box() in Header.pm to allow frame characters and indent
     to be controlled.
   - Fixed some patterns in Parser.pm which were not case-insensitive.
   - Find and store names of IML modules in Parser.pm.
   - Re-wrote _protect_semi to fix bug parsing ';' inside of quoted strings.
   - Added get_doc() method to Header.pm.
   - Modified the list accessors: procs(), macros(), macdefs(), datasets()
     and includes() to return a blank-separated string if called in a
     scalar context, to avoid the need to use join(' ', @list) all the time.
   - Put the sample scripts in a bin/ directory.
   - Added a simple rebox() to Header.pm

0.89  18 Jun 1999 14:17:53
   - Header.pm: Added parse_mdef(), macdescribe() and margs() to parse the
     argument list to a macro, and create a descriptive comment.
   - Fixed lots of small buglets.

0.90  20 Jun 1999 13:22:15
   - Header.pm: fixed bugs in macdescribe()

0.91  22 Jun 1999 10:41:47
   - Header.pm: Re-wrote macdescribe() to generalize the format of a macro
     description.
   - Now provide styles 'plain' and 'pod'.  sashead accepts a -style=
     argument.
   - Parser.pm: fixed small problem with %eval and %str being seen as
     macro calls.
   - Fixed problem with embedded %do ... %end inside a statement.  Now
     swallow all in current statement.
   - Fixed problem with label: not being recognized.

0.92  12 Jul 1999 09:10:23
   - Makefile.PL: check for Text:Balanced.pm during installation.
  - Header.pm: Generalized makeheader() to allow the keys and their
     order to be set from a caller.
   - Added 'html' style for macro descriptions.
   - Fixed nesting problem in output with several macros in one file.
   - Parser.pm: Added parse_module() NOOP stub for IML modules.
   - Fixed problem with 'cards = 4;' being treated as 'cards;'
   - Generalized handling of \n and path separator characters for
     various operating systems.  Should now work on other than Unix,
     but untested.

0.93  8 March 2006
   - Added SAS::Index.pm, bin/sasindx
   - Revised documentation and Makefile.PL for public release to CPAN
