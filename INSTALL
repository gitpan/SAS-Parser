INSTALLATION
     If you're reading this, you have successfully unpacked the
     distribution tar.gz archive.  cd there now.

     SAS::Parser follows the standard scheme for installing Perl
     extensions:
     
      perl Makefile.PL
      make
      make install

     This should install the lib/SAS/*.pm modules in the standard Perl
     library, and the bin/* scripts in someplace on your PATH
     (e.g., /usr/local/bin).  It will also make manpages for the
     lib/SAS/*.pm modules somewhere that man and perldoc can find.
     
     If this does not work for you, you may simply copy the .pm files in
     the lib/SAS/ directory to a SAS directory under the standard Perl
     lib/perl directory and the executable scripts to somewhere on
     your PATH.
     
      mkdir /usr/local/lib/perl5/SAS
      cp -p lib/SAS/* /usr/local/lib/perl5/SAS
      cp -p bin/* /usr/local/bin

     If even that doesn't work, you may just create a ~/lib/perl/SAS
     directory and copy the .pm files there.
     
      perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=~ LIB=~/lib/perl/SAS
      make
      make install

     or, by hand,
	  
      mkdir ~/lib/perl/SAS
      cp lib/* ~/lib/perl/SAS
      cp bin/* ~/bin
      
     You then have to tell Perl to search there for these modules, e.g.,
     
      use lib "$ENV{HOME}/lib/perl";

     in scripts, or
     
      perl -I~/lib/perl ...

     on the command line.
